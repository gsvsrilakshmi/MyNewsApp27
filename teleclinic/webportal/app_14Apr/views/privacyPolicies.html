<h2><b>USE OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;  font-size: 10px;">Protected health information (PHI) is information that includes, but is not limited to, identifying data such as name, social security number, address, contact information, as well as information about personal health issues. As a Business Associate of health care providers that are Covered Entities under the federal health care privacy and security rules (HIPAA and HITECH), we maintain PHI in compliance with these rules and our contractual obligations with health care providers. HIPAA allows Covered Entities to disclose protected health information (PHI) to Business Associates if the Business Associate assures that it will use the information only for the purposes for which it was engaged by the Covered Entity, will safeguard the information from misuse, and will help the Covered Entity comply with some of the Covered Entity’s duties under HIPAA. Covered Entities are required to enter into a Business Associate Agreement with Business Associates that include the aforementioned assurances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;  font-size: 10px;">We collect PHI solely for the purposes of providing the Services on the Site. We know that privacy is of the utmost importance. We vigorously believe in keeping secure any and all PHI that identifies an individual and have appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place to do so.</p>
